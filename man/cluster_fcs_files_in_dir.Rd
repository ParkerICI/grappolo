\title{Cluster all FCS files contained in a directory}
\usage{
cluster_fcs_files_in_dir(wd, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wd}{The directory containing the FCS files}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{cluster_fcs_files}
\describe{
  \item{num.cores}{Number of CPU cores to use}
  \item{col.names}{A vector of column names indicating which columns should be used for clustering}
  \item{num.clusters}{The desired number of clusters}
  \item{num.samples}{Number of samples to be used for the CLARA algorithm (see \code{cluster::clara})}
  \item{output.dir}{The name of the output directory, it will be created if it does not exist}
  \item{asinh.cofactor}{Cofactor for \code{asinh} transformation. If this is \code{NULL} no transformation is performed}
  \item{negative.values}{How to deal with negative values in the data. If this is \code{NULL} negative values
are left as is. Otherwise two options are possible:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{truncate}}: Negative values will be truncated (i.e. replaced with 0)
  \item{\code{shift}}: The data will be shifted so that only \code{quantile.prob} of the values for each channel will
    be truncated to 0. This option is useful in cases where the range of data significantly extends
    in the negatives, for instance due to compensation.
}}
  \item{quantile.prob}{Only used if \code{negative.value} is set to \code{shift}. The quantile of measurements
that are going to be truncated to 0. For instance if this is 0.05, the data will be shifted so that
only 5 percent of the values are negative and will be truncated to 0}
}}
}
\value{
Returns the list of files that have been clustered
